# OneCalendar

This project was born from the pain of synching calenders you want to share. But never properly works.

A will be adding more content to the ReadMe file and wiki page soon enough.

The app is built with:

* [.Net Core 2.2 API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/aspnetcore/new-db?tabs=visual-studio)
* JWT token validation - .Net Core 2.2 Authentication
* [FullCalendar.js](https://fullcalendar.io/)
* [BootStrap 3.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/)
* [jQuery 3.4.0](https://blog.jquery.com/)
* [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

I will be filling this list as I build this project.
